# This file supports the intercept that blocks access for separated employees.
# This file defines the list of sites that users are still allowed to access
# after they have departed; this is a short list and access to all other sites
# is blocked.
# The actual content of this file is a set of entityIds; access will be allowed
# if the entityId being accessed is on this list.
#
# This file is referenced by conf/intercept/warning-intercept-config.xml
# and is read by the class edu.washington.idp.intercept.impl.BlockAccessIntercept
# in the uw-slack-intercept plugin. That class checks the timestamp on this file
# and will reload it on the next access attempt if this file is updated.
